# Burdoc

A Markdown editor for the cloud.

## Development

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and you have it running. Then create a database called `burdoc` with no password:

```bash
createdb burdoc
```

Then clone down the repo, `cd` into the directory, and run `npm install` and `npm run build`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:calebkleveter/Burdoc.git
cd Burdoc/
npm install
npm run build
```
